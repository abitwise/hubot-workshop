# Bots

Here are all the awesome bots that were built _(copy-paste the example bot and fill in the details)_.

## Improbot

Improvised theatre is great - if only we knew when next shows happen! This bot will give you a schedule of upcoming
improvised theatre shows from [improvision.eu](https://improvision.eu).

- **Bot username**: `improbot@improvision.eu`
- **Team members**: [Ando Roots](https://twitter.com/sqrooted)
- **Problem to solve**: Get a list upcoming improv shows
- **Main user groups**: Improvisers and audience
- **Repo link (if public)**: [github.com/anroots/hubot-workshop](https://github.com/anroots/hubot-workshop)

This is a demo bot for the workshop, so not really much to say.

Supported commands for the bot:

- improbot get schedule - List upcoming imporov events
